Contributing to One Does Simply (ODS)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ODS! We're excited to build a community around the idea of making application development simpler for everyone.
This project is in its early stages, but any contribution, from a bug report to a feature idea, is highly valued.
How Can I Contribute?

Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in the specification, a framework, or the build helper, please let us know!
 * Check the existing issues to see if someone has already reported it.
 * If not, create a new issue. Be sure to include a clear title, a concise description of the problem, and any steps to reproduce the issue.

Suggesting Enhancements or New Features
Have an idea for a new component, an improvement to the build helper, or a change to the specification? We'd love to hear it.
 * Create a new issue to start the discussion.
 * Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and, most importantly, explain why it aligns with the ODS mantra of keeping things simple.

Pull Requests
While the core architecture is currently being established, we are open to pull requests for bug fixes or approved enhancements.
 * Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
 * Make your changes.
 * Ensure your code lints and follows the existing style.
 * Issue that pull request!
