One Does Simply (ODS)

"One does not simply do complex things, but One Does Simply do simple things."

What is ODS?

One Does Simply (ODS) is an open-source project dedicated to a simple truth: simple applications can and should be defined simply. ODS provides a clear, concise specification for defining simple, data-driven applications using a JSON file.
This specification can then be rendered by any compatible Framework, giving citizen developers the power to create useful applications without getting bogged down by the complexities of UI/UX design, proprietary ecosystems, or vendor lock-in.

The Problem

Many low-code and no-code platforms fail for a few key reasons:
 * They try to do too much. They start simple but quickly add overwhelming complexity.
 * They expect users to be designers. Good UI/UX is incredibly difficult, yet most platforms leave it to the user.
 * They create lock-in. Moving an application out of a proprietary ecosystem often means starting over from scratch.
 * They trap your data. Data is often held in expensive, proprietary databases that are difficult to access or migrate.

The ODS Solution

ODS solves these problems by separating concerns into a clear, three-part ecosystem:
 * The Specification: A simple, open-source JSON schema that defines the structure and logic of an application. It's the universal blueprint.
 * Frameworks: Real-time renderers for the ODS specification. A framework handles the complex parts—UI/UX, security, and data management—allowing the citizen developer to focus on the "what," not the "how." Frameworks also provide an "off-ramp" by generating professional source code, ensuring you are never locked in.
 * The Build Helper: A conversational AI tool that guides users through the process of creating an ODS JSON file, turning their ideas into a well-structured application definition.

Getting Started

(This section will be updated once the first reference framework is complete.)
To get a feel for the ODS specification, check out the example customer-feedback-app.json which defines a complete, two-page customer feedback application.
